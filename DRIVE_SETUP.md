# Google Drive Distribution Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you set up Google Drive as an alternative distribution method for your ARISE SOLO APK file. This provides users with a reliable, fast download option.

## Benefits of Google Drive Distribution

- âœ… **No file size limits** - Unlike GitHub's 25MB limit
- âœ… **Fast downloads** - Google's global CDN
- âœ… **Reliable hosting** - Google's infrastructure
- âœ… **Easy sharing** - Simple link sharing
- âœ… **Download tracking** - Optional analytics
- âœ… **Mobile-friendly** - Works great on phones

## Step 1: Upload APK to Google Drive

### Option A: Using Google Drive Web Interface

1. **Go to Google Drive**: [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com)
2. **Upload your APK file**:
   - Click the "+ New" button
   - Select "File upload"
   - Choose your `arise-solo-app.apk` file
   - Wait for upload to complete

3. **Get the sharing link**:
   - Right-click on the uploaded file
   - Select "Share"
   - Click "Copy link"
   - The link will look like: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing`

### Option B: Using Google Drive API (Advanced)

If you want to automate uploads, you can use the Google Drive API with scripts.

## Step 2: Configure Sharing Settings

1. **Set sharing permissions**:
   - Right-click on your APK file
   - Select "Share"
   - Click "Change to anyone with the link"
   - Set permission to "Viewer"
   - Click "Done"

2. **Get the direct download link**:
   - The sharing link format: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing`
   - Convert to direct download: `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID`

## Step 3: Update Website Configuration

### Update the HTML Link

In `index.html`, replace the placeholder with your actual Google Drive file ID:

```html
<!-- Find this line in the download section -->
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/YOUR_DRIVE_FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing" class="btn btn-drive" target="_blank">

<!-- Replace YOUR_DRIVE_FILE_ID with your actual file ID -->
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123DEF456GHI789/view?usp=sharing" class="btn btn-drive" target="_blank">
```

### File ID Extraction

Your Google Drive link looks like this:
```
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ABC123DEF456GHI789/view?usp=sharing
```

The file ID is the part between `/d/` and `/view`:
```
1ABC123DEF456GHI789
```

## Step 4: Test the Download

1. **Test the link**:
   - Open the Google Drive link in a browser
   - Verify the file downloads correctly
   - Test on mobile devices

2. **Update website**:
   - Replace the placeholder in `index.html`
   - Deploy the updated website
   - Test the download button

## Step 5: Optional Enhancements

### Add Download Analytics

You can track downloads by adding Google Analytics to your website:

```html
<!-- Add this to your HTML head section -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=GA_MEASUREMENT_ID"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'GA_MEASUREMENT_ID');
</script>
```

### Create Multiple Download Options

You can add more distribution methods:

```html
<div class="download-option">
    <h4>Alternative Download</h4>
    <p>Download from alternative server</p>
    <a href="https://your-alternative-server.com/arise-solo-app.apk" class="btn btn-alternative">
        <i class="fas fa-cloud-download-alt"></i>
        Alternative Download
    </a>
</div>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Link Not Working
- Check that the file is shared with "Anyone with the link"
