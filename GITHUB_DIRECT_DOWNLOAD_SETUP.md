# Getting the Correct Direct Download URL

## Current Issue
The GitHub button is redirecting to the GitHub releases page instead of directly downloading the APK file.

## Solution: Get the Exact Direct Download URL

### Step 1: Find Your APK File Name
1. Go to: https://github.com/Trying-1/arisesololandinpage/releases/tag/v1.0.0
2. Look at the "Assets" section
3. Find your APK file and note its exact filename (e.g., `app-release.apk`, `arise-solo.apk`, etc.)

### Step 2: Create the Direct Download URL
The format is:
```
https://github.com/Trying-1/arisesololandinpage/releases/download/v1.0.0/YOUR_EXACT_FILENAME.apk
```

### Step 3: Update the Website
Once you have the exact filename, I'll update the website with the correct direct download URL.

## Alternative: Quick Fix
If you want to test this now, you can:

1. **Right-click on your APK file** in the GitHub release
2. **Copy the download link**
3. **Share that link with me**
4. I'll update the website immediately

## What This Will Do
- ✅ Direct download (no redirect to GitHub)
- ✅ Starts download immediately when clicked
- ✅ No account required for users
- ✅ Professional experience

## Example
If your file is named `app-release.apk`, the URL would be:
```
https://github.com/Trying-1/arisesololandinpage/releases/download/v1.0.0/app-release.apk
```

**Please share the exact filename of your APK file, and I'll update the website right away!**
